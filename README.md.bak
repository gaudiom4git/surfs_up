# Surfs Up Analysis
Module 9 Challenge

## Overview of Project
The objective of this project was to learn how to connect and extract information from a SQLite SQLAlchemy database.
Temperature and precipitation measurements were taken at select weather stations.  A potential business
man, W. Avy, wanted to open a surf and ice cream shop and wanted to make sure that the potential location 
in Hawaii had weather that would support the business.

After extracting the information from the database, we used Numpy to produce statistics including mean / average, 
max/min, and median temperatures for the area.   Data extracted and analyzed were for the months of June and 
December (multiple years).
